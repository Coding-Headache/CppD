# CppD
## C++ Development

This is a module studied during my 2nd year `BSc Computer Systems Integration` at the University of the West of England _**(UWE)**_

#### Welcome Back
Throughout the 1st year we learned how to code with C, but after the summer break we are tasked to write a few C programs to "get back into the swing of things" so to say.

#### Grading - Week 2
This task is to learn some basic **C++** syntax by producing a simple grading program.

#### Week 3 - UML
This does not exist, well it was a task on **UML** which I have not loaded onto Github.

#### Week 4 - classes
Learning about classes and their implementation.

#### Week 5
TODO

#### Week 6
This was a timed exercise, which I was away for so never completed. I may try to complete it once I have caught up though.

#### Week 7 - Debbugging
We are provided with some buggy code that we are to debug whilst learning about the tools available with Visual Studio.

#### Week 8 - Templates & STLs
Gain a knowledge of templates to give more capabilities when coding.
