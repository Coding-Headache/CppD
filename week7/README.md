## Week 7 - Debugging Code

This exercise is designed in order to learn how to use the debugging tools within MS Visual Studio.

The program itself is supposed to print Pascal's Triangle, as shown below:

```sh
Enter the number of rows (<= 13) in Pascals Triangle: 5

TABLE 1: THE FIRST 5 ROWS OF PASCALs TRIANGLE:

               1
              1 1
             1 2 1
            1 3 3 1
           1 4 6 4 1
```

However, it wouldn't be a task for learning to debug code, when the code that was provided actually worked! The output of week7_ORIGINAL.cpp is as follows:

```sh
Enter the number of rows (<= 13) in Pascals Triangle: 5

TABLE 1: THE FIRST 5 ROWS OF PASCALs TRIANGLE:

                      1
                   16   4   1
                121  35   8   2   1
```
NICE!!

### Using This Project.
