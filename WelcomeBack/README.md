## WelcomeBack

Upon our return to uni after the summer break a worksheet was assigned in order to get us back into the swing of programming.  As students we have obviously been tarred with the reputation of not having done any preparatory work over the summer....

I have **NO** idea where they get these ideas from! I'm sure the others managed to do some, just as I had _hmmm_....

Initially I had written them as separate programs, but when I had asked for a little advice from one of the other students I had seen that he had written in a `switch` statement, so I kinda attempted it myself.

### Task 1
Hello World...

### Task 2
Ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with their name...

### Task 3
Ask for a number (n), then calculate the sum of numbers up to n, printing the result...

### Task 4
Modify the previous task to only use those numbers that are a multiple of 3 or 5...

### Task 7
Take user input of the year, then print all leap years that occur over the next 20 years.
