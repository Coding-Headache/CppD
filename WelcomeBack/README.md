## WelcomeBack

Upon our return to uni after the summer break a worksheet was assigned in order to get us back into the swing of programming.  As students we have obviously been tarred with the reputation of not having done any preparatory work over the summer....

I have **NO** idea where they get these ideas from! I'm sure the others managed to do some, just as I had _hmmm_....

Initially I had written them as separate programs, but when I had asked for a little advice from one of the other students I had seen that he had written in a `switch` statement, so I kinda attempted it myself.
